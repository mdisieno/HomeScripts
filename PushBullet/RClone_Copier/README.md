This is simple bash script that will take in two arguements (share and location, in whichever order you want to send it) and handles the 1:1 copy from one location to another. It requires the installation and configuration of RClone and Screen on your part, but it will show a verbose of speed and everything within a Screen session, and then at the end pushes a notification to a PB channel you want via a config you've set within the file. Simple, easy effective.
