A simple bit of CLI love for Pushbullet. I use it on a lot of applications, machines and services. Using the channels option you can centrally aggregate all your notifications in one spot for yourself and others. You can stem this to whatever you need but I use it for SSH login monitoring, as well as process completion and etc.
